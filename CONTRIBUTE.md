1. Which repository setup will we use?\
    The group has chosen the mono-repository setup, due to not wanting to overcomplicate a simple project
2. Which branching model will we use?\
    We have chosen the git-flow branching model, as most of us have worked with this before, and we feel it works well
3. Which distributed development workflow will we use?\
    We are using the centralised workflow sharing a repository, because we are confortable with this, and feel that our git branching strategy works well with this setup.
4. How do we expect contributions to look like?\
    An explanation on changes, and confinement to a single feature to make them simple. If new tech is added, a link to the documentation.
5. Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?\
    The group takes shared responsibility for this. A pull request requires 2 reviews to be approved.
